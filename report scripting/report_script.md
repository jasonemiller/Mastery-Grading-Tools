The main table in this report lists the learning targets that are available for assessment at this point in the semester.  Your goal is to provide evidence of your mastery of as many learning targets as possible by the end of the semester.  

Those learning targets that you have not assessed yet are clearly indicated by a 'Not attempted'.  Next to those you have attempted is a symbol that indicates your level of mastery of that learning target.  These symbols mean


\begin{tabular}{ccl}
S & -- & Your work has provided satisfactory evidence of mastery \\
&& of the learning target.  \\
U & -- & Your work has provided unsatisfactory evidence of mastery \\
&& of the learning target.  You should study the topic some \\
&&more and reassess.  \\
N & -- & Your work has provided no evidence of mastery of the \\
&&learning target.  You must study the topic again before \\
&&reassessing.  \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

Your final grade in this course\footnote{See the syllabus for how grades are associated with mastery of learning targets.} depends on the number of 'S' evaluations you acumulate by the end of the semester.

\noindent To date, this is my record of our learning targets and your assessments:
